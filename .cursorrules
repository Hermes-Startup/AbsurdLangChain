# Cursor Rules for Prompt Shadowing

## MANDATORY: Prompt Logging Requirement

Before executing any code changes, responding to user requests, or making any modifications, you MUST:

1. **Write your understanding of the user's intent/prompt to `.prompts/` directory**
2. **File naming format**: `YYYY-MM-DD-HHMMSS-[short-hash].md`
   - Example: `2024-01-15-143022-a3f9.md`
3. **File content format**:
   ```markdown
   # Prompt Log
   Timestamp: [ISO timestamp]
   User Intent: [exact user request/prompt]
   Context: [relevant code context or file paths mentioned]
   Plan: [your execution plan or approach]
   Actions: [what you will do]
   ```

## When to Log

- **ALWAYS** log before making any code changes
- **ALWAYS** log when responding to user questions that involve code
- **ALWAYS** log when the user asks you to create, modify, or delete files
- **ALWAYS** log when explaining code or providing solutions

## File Structure Requirements

- Create files in `.prompts/` directory (create it if it doesn't exist)
- Use markdown format (`.md` extension)
- Include full context of what the user asked for
- Be specific about the user's intent

## Example

If user says: "Add a button to the homepage"

You must create: `.prompts/2024-01-15-143022-a3f9.md` with:
```markdown
# Prompt Log
Timestamp: 2024-01-15T14:30:22Z
User Intent: Add a button to the homepage
Context: app/page.tsx
Plan: 
1. Import Button component
2. Add button JSX to homepage
3. Style appropriately
Actions: Modify app/page.tsx to include button component
```

## Important Notes

- This logging is MANDATORY for all interactions
- Do not skip this step
- The `.prompts/` folder will be processed automatically
- Write the file BEFORE making any code changes
